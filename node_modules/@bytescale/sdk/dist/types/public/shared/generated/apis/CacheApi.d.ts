     * Resets the Bytescale CDN cache for a specific path, path prefix, or for your entire account.  You can choose to reset the edge cache, or permanent cache, or both caches.  *Warning:* Resetting the permanent cache (by setting ```resetPermanentCache: true```) may lead to a significant increase in processing time if numerous file transformations need to be re-performed upon their next request.  *Recommended:* Prevent cache resets by adding a ```?v=<etag>``` querystring parameter to your URLs. This ensures your URLs change when your files change, eliminating the need for cache resets. The `etag` field is returned by GetFileDetails and all upload operations, and can be saved to your database.  *Example patterns:*  - ```\"/_*\"``` - ```\"/raw/example.jpg\"``` - ```\"/image/example.jpg\"``` - ```\"/image/customers/abc/_*\"```  You may only use ```*``` at the end of the pattern. You must not include your account ID prefix in the pattern.
